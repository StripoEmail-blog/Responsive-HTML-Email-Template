## Ensuring Consistency: Inline Your CSS

Owing to the inconsistent CSS support across different email clients, it's essential to inline your CSS before sending any **email template**. This ensures that your email displays as intended across various email clients.

If you are integrating our **template email** into your codebase or using a developer service like Mailgun, SendGrid, or Postmark, you'll need to inline the CSS prior to sending. You can refer to `email-inlined.html` for an example.

## Instructions for CSS Inlining:

1. Copy the entire content from `email.html`.
2. Paste this HTML into an Email CSS Inliner tool.
3. Copy the inliner's HTML output.
4. Use this output as the **email template** you send.

Always remember to send a test email to yourself before rolling it out to your audience, to ensure your **template for email** renders as expected.

## Using a Marketing Service? No Problem!

If you're using a marketing service like Mailchimp, you can use the **template email.html** as it is. These services will take care of the CSS inlining for you when you create your campaign.
